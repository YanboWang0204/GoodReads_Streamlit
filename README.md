# *GoodReads*: Book Analytics & Recommendation System
A repository for GoodReads.com project interaction tool via Streamlit

## Module 3 - User Interaction

In order to provide better user experience with our Book Analytics and Recommendation system, our group decided to develop an interactive web-based user interface and deploy it online such that every user can access our system and enjoy the functions to help build their next to-read book lists. 

You can directly access our system online through this link: [GoodReads_Interaction Page](https://yanbowang0204-goodreads-streamlit-homepage-wvf2th.streamlit.app/)

*In case you have any problems accessing the website, it might because our web page meets the resource limit and need to reboot it for new users. In that case, please contact us by [email](yanbo.wang@berkeley.edu) to let us know, thank you.*

To let users more easily use and deploy our app, I moved all required datasets to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CiYtbIOu1nbkEJK9ceLJ5Hx2mUh158RD) as public Google sheets, you can assess them if you are interested in the raw sources.

We build this website with package `Streamlit`, a very powerful python package that allows developers build a website App without too much front-end knowledge. If you want to build it in your local host to replicate our project, just download this repository and run the following command in terminal:

`streamlit run Homepage.py`

*Be careful about absolute path problem when using terminal commands*
